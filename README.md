## Project Motivation
I designed and trained a dog breed classifier for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree as a capstone project.

I chose this project because I wanted to do a project with CNN, because I find the technology behind it very interesting and because I am a dog person.  

I wrote a [Blog Post on Medium](https://medium.com/@marco.schlinger/37261c88fd2a) that should give a better insight into my approach and results.

## File Descriptions
A notebook is available which addresses all the steps to the final result. Comments in it explain the procedure in more detail.

To run the notebook you need files from the Udacity workspace. Unfortunately, I was not able to put them on GitHub.

There is also a folder with the test images available.

Acknowledgement should go to [Udacity](udacity.com/) for providing the script and dataset.
